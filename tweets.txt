why arent the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. a terrible decision

make america great again!
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the fake news unicorn is still lost!
the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban. they know if certain people are allowed in its death and destruction!
when a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in and out, especially for reasons of safety and.security - big trouble!
countries charge u.s. companies taxes or tariffs while the u.s. charges them nothing or little.we should charge them same as they charge us!

iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u.s. has squandered three trillion dollars there. obvious long ago!
